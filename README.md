ForegroundPing
==============

Flashes screen edges when foreground window changes.

Shamelessly based of of the snippet of Raymond Chen on playing a sound clip when foreground window changed: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/09/30/10452928.aspx

I thought it was useful, but a visual effect would have been better, as I might not always have headphones on or my music might overtake the feint sound.

So I made this small program that flashes screen edge red (only main display for now) on foreground window focus change.
